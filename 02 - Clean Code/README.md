> You are reading this book for two reasons. First, you are a programmer. Second, you want
to be a better programmer. Good. We need better programmers.

> Had you sometime wade through code? Well, this is a bad code.

> LeBlanc’s law: Later equals never

>  Attittude: Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the schedule. They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that’s their job. ** It’s your job to defend the code with equal passion. **

> "The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease  maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations" - Bjarne Stroustrup -  inventor of C++

> "...Clean code reads like well-written prose." - Grady Booch - author of  Object Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications  

> "Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares." - Michael Feathers, author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code  

> if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read.

> Rule of The Boy Scouts of America: Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

> Other book: Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices (PPP).
