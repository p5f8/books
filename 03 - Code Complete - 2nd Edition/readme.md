## Part I - Laying the Foundation

### Chapter 01 - Welcome to Software Construction

> Some distinct activitives: Problem definition, Requirements development, Construction planning, Software architecture, or high-level design, Detailed design, Coding and debugging, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Integration, System testing, Corrective maintenance

> The quality of the construction substantially affects the quality of the software.

> In the final analysis, your understanding of how to do construction determines how good a programmer you are, and that’s the subject of the rest of the book.


### Chapter 02 - Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Development

> Metaphors

Metaphors are heuristics, not algorithms. As such, they tend to be a little sloppy.  

> Software Penmanship: Writing Code

Fred Brooks’s The Mythical Man-Month (Brooks 1995). Brooks says, “Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.” Not so good idea.  

> Software Farming: Growing a System

The weakness in the software-farming metaphor is its suggestion that you don’t have any direct control over how the software develops.  

> Software Oyster Farming: System Accretion

Accretion describes the way an oyster makes a pearl, by gradually adding small amounts of calcium carbonate.     

Incremental designing, building, and testing are some of the most powerful software-development concepts available.  

Tom Gilb made the same point in his breakthrough book, Principles of Software Engineering Management (1988)  

> Software Construction: Building Software

Building software implies various stages of planning, preparation, and execution that vary in kind and degree depending on what’s being built.  

Careful planning doesn’t necessarily mean exhaustive planning or over-planning.   

“What Supports the Roof?” (Starr 2003).

> Applying Software Techniques: The Intellectual Toolbox 

Metaphors are not mutually exclusive. Use the combination of metaphors that works best for you.
