## Part I - Laying the Foundation

### Chapter 01 - Welcome to Software Construction

> Some distinct activitives: Problem definition, Requirements development, Construction planning, Software architecture, or high-level design, Detailed design, Coding and debugging, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Integration, System testing, Corrective maintenance

> The quality of the construction substantially affects the quality of the software.

> In the final analysis, your understanding of how to do construction determines how good a programmer you are, and that’s the subject of the rest of the book.


### Chapter 02 - Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Development

> Metaphors

Metaphors are heuristics, not algorithms. As such, they tend to be a little sloppy.  

> Software Penmanship: Writing Code

Fred Brooks’s The Mythical Man-Month (Brooks 1995). Brooks says, “Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.” Not so good idea.  

> Software Farming: Growing a System

The weakness in the software-farming metaphor is its suggestion that you don’t have any direct control over how the software develops.  

> Software Oyster Farming: System Accretion

Accretion describes the way an oyster makes a pearl, by gradually adding small amounts of calcium carbonate.     

Incremental designing, building, and testing are some of the most powerful software-development concepts available.  

Tom Gilb made the same point in his breakthrough book, Principles of Software Engineering Management (1988)  

> Software Construction: Building Software

Building software implies various stages of planning, preparation, and execution that vary in kind and degree depending on what’s being built.  

Careful planning doesn’t necessarily mean exhaustive planning or over-planning.   

“What Supports the Roof?” (Starr 2003).

> Applying Software Techniques: The Intellectual Toolbox 

Metaphors are not mutually exclusive. Use the combination of metaphors that works best for you.

### Chapter 03 - Measure Twice, Cut Once: Upstream Prerequisites

> A builder prepares for building a skyscraper one way, a housing development a different way, and a doghouse a third way.  

> Paying attention to quality is also the best way to improve productivity.  

> If you emphasize quality at the beginning of the project, you plan for, require, and design a high-quality product.  

>  In software development, you do such planning when you **define the problem**, **when you specify the solution**, and **when you design the solution**.

> The overarching goal of preparation is risk reduction: a good project planner clears major risks out of the way as early as possible so that the bulk of the project can proceed as smoothly as possible.

> By far the most common project risks in software development are poor requirements and poor project planning, thus preparation tends to focus on improving requirements and project plans.  

> The skills needed to plan a project, create a compelling business case, develop comprehensive and accurate requirements, and create high-quality architectures are far from trivial, but most developers have not received training in how to perform these activities.  

> WISCA or WIMP syndrome: Why Isn’t Sam Coding Anything? or Why Isn’t Mary Programming?

> Try plan first: prerequisite, architecture, design, implement
Your boss is an asshole?
Well, you have three options: yes, sir, pretend you are coding and plan instead, and the last one, find another job and live is to short to work with an asshole.  

> Utterly Compelling and Foolproof Argument for Doing Prerequisites Before Construction
One of the key ideas in effective programming is that preparation is important.

> Determine the Kind of Software You’re Working On

> 40 different methods for gathering requirements, 50 variations in working on software designs and 30 kinds of testing applied.  

> Choosing Between Iterative and Sequential Approaches  

> You might choose a more sequential (upfront) approach when: The requirements are fairly stable, little risk, dev team familiar with the applications area, etc.

> You might choose a more iterative (as-you-go) approach when: The requirements are not well understood or you expect them to be unstable for other reasons, high risk, dev team unfamiliar with the applications area, etc.
