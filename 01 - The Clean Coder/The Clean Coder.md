The Clean Coder  
A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers
Author: Robert C. Martin  
  
Chapter 01 - Clean Code
-----------------------

- Be Careful What You Ask For
  
  What would happen if you allowed a bug to slip through a module, and it cost your company $10,000 ?
  The nonprofessional would shrug his shoulders, say "stuff happens", and start writing the next module.
  The professional would write the company a check for $ 10,000!

  
- Taking Responsability
  
  Always ship with tests.

- First, Do No Harm

  Drawing from the Hippocratic oath ?
  What harm can a software developer do?
  
- Do no harm To Function

  As programmers, we want our software to work. As ours customers and employers.
  We harm the function of our software when we create bugs.
  
- QA Should Find Nothing

  It is unprofessional in the extreme to purposely send code that you know to be faulty to QA.
  If QA or user find a bug, you should be determined to prevent it from happening again.

- You Must Know It Works

  TDD always.
  80% tests codes at least.
