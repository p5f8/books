The Clean Coder  
A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers  
Author: Robert C. Martin  
  
Chapter 01 - Clean Code
-----------------------

- Be Careful What You Ask For
  
  What would happen if you allowed a bug to slip through a module, and it cost your company $10,000 ?  
  The nonprofessional would shrug his shoulders, say "stuff happens", and start writing the next module.  
  The professional would write the company a check for $ 10,000!  

  
- Taking Responsability
  
  Always ship with tests.

- First, Do No Harm

  Drawing from the Hippocratic oath ?  
  What harm can a software developer do?
  
- Do no harm To Function

  As programmers, we want our software to work. As ours customers and employers.  
  We harm the function of our software when we create bugs.
  
- QA Should Find Nothing

  It is unprofessional in the extreme to purposely send code that you know to be faulty to QA.  
  If QA or user find a bug, you should be determined to prevent it from happening again.

- You Must Know It Works

  TDD always.
  80% tests codes at least.
  
- Automated QA

- Do No Harm To Structure

  Software should be easy to change.  
  You should be able to make changes without exorbitant costs. Ever.  
  Merciless refactoring.  
  Programmers should treat software the way a sculptor treats clay - they continuously shape and mold it.  
  
- Work Ethic

  Your carrer is your responsability.  
  Work 40 hours, and study 20 hours. (Martin's Law)  
  Work 40 hours, and study 10 hours. (Pablo's Law) :-)
  
- Know Your Field

  Do you know what a Nassi-Schneiderman chart is? If not, why not?   
  Do you know the difference between a Mealy and a Moore state machine? You should.  
  Could you write a quicksort without looking it up?   
  Do you know what the term “Transform Analysis” means?  
  Could you perform a functional decomposition with Data Flow Diagrams?  
  What does the term “Tramp Data” mean?   
  Have you heard the term “Conascence”?  
  What is a Parnas Table?  
  
  Remember Santayana’s curse: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”  
  
  -- Design patterns. You ought to be able to describe all 24 patterns in the GOF book and have a working knowledge of many of the patterns in the POSA books.  
  -- Design principles. You should know the SOLID principles and have a good understanding of the component principles.  
  -- Methods. You should understand XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, and Structured Design.  
  -- Disciplines. You should practice TDD, Object-Oriented design, Structured Programming, Continuous Integration, and Pair Programming.  
  -- Artifacts: You should know how to use: UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petri Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Tables, flow charts, and decision tables.  
  
- Continuous Learning

- Practice
  
  Do a Kata or two every day!  
  
  Learn another language.

- Collaboration

  Work with other, but get away by yourself to work!  
  
- Mentoring


- Know Your Domain

- Identify With Your Employer / Customer

  Your employer’s problems are your problems.

- Humility

  So when a professional finds himself the butt of a joke, he’ll be the first to laugh.  
  He will never ridicule others, but will accept ridicule when it is deserved and laugh it off when it’s not.  
  Howard’s advice: Laugh

Chapter 02 - Saying No
----------------------
  
- Professionals speak truth to power. Professionals have the courage to say no to their managers.  
  Aren't you supposed to do what your boss says? No. Not if you are a professional.  
  Slaves are not allowed to say no.  

- Adversarial Roles
  One of the reviewers of this book truly hated this chapter. He had built teams where there were no adversarial relationships; the teams worked together in harmony and without confrontation.  
  But I wonder if his teams are really as confrontation free as he supposes.  
  
- Say no at first! And then work out a solution that is mutually agreeable to both.

- What About The Why?
  Why it will take two weeks is just a detail.  
  Providing too much detail can be an invitation for micro-management.  

- High Stakes  
  "Firing me isn’t going to change the estimate, Charles"  
  
- Being a "Team Player"
  Never say trying, only say it's possible or not.

- Trying
  Yoda: "There is no trying."  
  By promising to try you are saying that you have a new plan. What is that new plan?  
  
- Passive Aggression
  Happen when you let things happen. Interesting...
  Always say no at all the right times, and in all the right ways.

- The Cost Of Saying Yes
